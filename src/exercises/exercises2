**** Exercises week 2 ***

Your profile
------------
- If you're new to programming, do as many exercises as possible, 1 and 2 will prepare
  for lab1. But, you can't spend all your time on exercises, lab 1 need time and are mandatory.
  Decide when to switch. Do left over exercises later or as exam recap.
- If experienced I think at least some of the later exercises will be a bit challenging

NOTE: Some exercises uses JavaFX. Possibly must check Edit Configurations ...
to have the correct path and JavaFX modules, see course page > Resources >
Java, JavaFX och IntelliJ

Exercises
---------

1.  See Ex1ArrayMethod. Implement methods. In general program should just print "true".
    The only exception is the shuffle method. Method uses Random, so hard to test.
    Print out for shuffle should look something like:

    [0, 0, 1, 0, -1, -1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1]     (randomly ordered elements)
    [-1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, -1, 1, 1, 0, 1, -1, 0, -1]
    [-1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0, 1, 1, -1, 1, 0, -1]
    [-1, -1, 0, 0, -1, -1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
    [0, 0, 1, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
    [1, -1, 0, 0, 1, -1, 1, 1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, -1]
    [1, 1, 1, -1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, -1, -1, 0, 1, -1]
    [-1, 1, 1, 0, -1, 0, -1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, -1]
    [1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1]
    ...

    See code for comments.

2.  See Ex2MatrixMethods. Implement methods so that program prints true for everything.
    Use functional decomposition if things getting too complex.

3.  See Ex3Theory. Just uncomment (possibly run) and explain result (write it here)
    1.  (write short explanation)
    2.
    3.
    4.
    5.

4.  Ex4GameOfLife. Implement a simulation of "Game of Life", see
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
    and https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/

    This is s graphical program, all graphics already implemented using JavaFX,
    you don't need to do (or understand) any graphics coding (but is simple and fun ...).

    a) Implement the init() method. The method should create and initialize the world with Cells
       (a square matrix with Cells). See code.

       - Sketch a plan and discuss with assistant before implementing!

    b) Now implement the update() method. The method should calculate the next state for all
       Cells in the world (using the rules).
       Method called automatically by a timer, don't need to call it. Rendering will be done automatically

       - If new: Make a plan! Discuss with assistants
       - Extensive use of testing! See comments and test() method.

5.  Given an array consisting 0s, 1s and 2s. The task is to write a method that sorts
    the given array. The method should put all 0s first, then all 1s and all 2s in last.
    You may not use any extra space (other arrays) and the method should run through the array
    only once.

6.  See Ex6ThreeSumToZero. Write a method that given a sorted array of integers checks if any three of
    the elements has the sum 0. If so, the indices for the (first) elements found are returned as an array.
    If not, the empty array is returned.
    NOTE: The method must be efficient i.e. not use more than 2 nested loops!
